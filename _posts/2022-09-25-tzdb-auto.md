# Background

Since the start of the [TZDB](https://github.com/pavkam/tzdb/) project, I have been keeping it up to date by downloading the latest IANA database, and then, rebuilding the code and testing the changes manually.

This has become somewhat of a chore and I have automated it by creating a custom [shell script](https://github.com/pavkam/tzdb/update-compile.sh) that does everything in one go -- _download the latest IANA, windows TZ aliases, build, test and update the version_. This has freed me to simply run the script when a new release of IANA pops up, followed by a push and release.

This, however, still required me to pay attention to the IANA releases and find time to do the manual work. Thus, I have decided to automate myself out of the equation completely by using **Github Actions**.

To achieve this, I have set up three actions in GitHub:
* **Test**, which runs the unit tests after each push to the `master` branch,
* **Release**, which is run after a push to the **master** repo,
* **Bump**, which runs the _update-compile.sh_ script and pushes the changes to the repo.

Below are the listings of the two important workflows (**Bump** and **Release**):

# Bump workflow

As previously stated, this action, sets up the environment for the latest _FreePascal_ and then executes the _update-compile.sh_ in `ci` mode. This mode will do everything I would do manually, including pushing the updated files to the `master` branch.

The action is triggered once a month on the 1st day.

[Bump](https://github.com/pavkam/tzdb/.github/workflows/bump.yml)
```yaml
name: TZDB/CLDR Bump

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
    paths:
      - './update-compile.sh'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 1 1-12 *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 
      - name: Install Free-Pascal
        run: sudo apt-get install -y fpc
      - name: Configure git
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'Alexandru Ciobanu [bot]'
          git config --global user.email 'alex+git[bot]@ciobanu.org'
      - name: Update the Library
        run: mkdir ./bin && ./update-compile.sh ci
```

# Release workflow

This action runs once files are pushed to the `master` branch and will use GitHub API to create a new release using the changes.

[Release](https://github.com/pavkam/tzdb/.github/workflows/realease.yml)
```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:        
      - '*'

jobs:
  release:
    name: "Release"

    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"

    steps:
      - name: "Determine Tag"
        run: "echo \"RELEASE_TAG=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}\" >> $GITHUB_ENV"

      - name: "Create Release"
        uses: "actions/github-script@v5"
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          script: |
            try {
              await github.rest.repos.createRelease({
                draft: false,
                generate_release_notes: true,
                name: 'TZDB ' + process.env.RELEASE_TAG,
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                prerelease: false,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                tag_name: process.env.RELEASE_TAG,
              });
            } catch (error) {
              core.setFailed(error.message);
            }
```

# Final words

This setup has now completely removes myself from the manual work I was _forced_ to do and also ensures that latest IANA updates are available at most one month after they are released.

Big thanks to our _GitHub overlords_ for helping us free ourselves from the manual labour!
