##### It seems I can't stop posting over the holiday season...

It's been more than a year since I have completely switched to `GNU/Linux` as my primary work environment. This has happened, in part, thanks to my new employer that promotes the use of __UNIX-like__ tooling and stacks. 

Now, this is mostly notewortthy for me, since I have spent most of my career developing on and for - Windows. I was always a GNU/Linux hobbyist, but switching off Windows entirely was always out of reach.

Yes, I have tried __WSL__ on Windows and loved it; but ultimately there was no great benefit of using it over my existing development setup (which is basically *Visual Studio*).

Well, that all has changed and I started using new tools, new languages and new frameworks. The cognitive overload was getting to me so I decided to simplify my life by automating my workflow and creating a standard set of configurations I could always rely on. What's worse, I have multiple machines and I want to carry over the same environment no matter which one I use.

**Please welcome the `dotfiles`** - the time-honored tradition of putting all your preferences into one repository and reusing them on all your machines. And finally, after collecting and setting up each individual configuration option I managed to make the environment work for me rather than me working for it.



The `dotfiles` are public and hosted on GitHub here: [pavkam/dotfiles](https://github.com/pavkam/dotfiles). If you find anything useful feel free to grab it and use it yourself.

### Happy New Year!
