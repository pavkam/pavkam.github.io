Latest version of **TZDB 2.1 (2019b)** was released a few weeks ago. I strongly encourage everyone to update to this version as it contains a new core and multiple fixes based on those that core.

On a related note, I have worked with Embarcadero to list it in the GetIt store.

The latest source code is available [here](https://github.com/pavkam/tzdb/releases/tag/2.1.2019b).

Enjoy!
