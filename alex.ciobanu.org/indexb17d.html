								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once every N years I give Linux a try. I&#8217;ve been a great supporter in the past and I always enjoyed tinkering with my OSes. I gradually lost the appetite due to jobs always requiring a windows PC, making the use of Linux a pain.</p>
<p>For my previous attempt to use Linux, in the summer of 2017, I used my Dell XPS 13 (9350) machine. This model is touted by Dell and Ubuntu as &#8220;<em>Linux developer friendly</em>&#8220;. I used an <strong>Ubuntu 16.04</strong> as my distribution of choice. In short &#8212; I was disappointed. Nothing was working properly, the system was crashing and overheating. I gave up after a couple of days.</p>
<p>Well, since it has been a year, time for another try &#8211; this time using <strong>Ubuntu 18.04</strong>. It&#8217;s been a week so far and <strong>I am still using it</strong>, which says a lot (for me at least).</p>
<h6>The bad:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Wayland was not fixed, but simply, not used.</li>
<li>The default session is based on Gnome 3, which is buggy and slow. CPU usage on minimal interaction was extremely high. Even things like <em>glxgears</em> was jerky every few seconds.</li>
<li>Hibernation needs to be enabled manually, and a lot of Googling has to be done prior to that point.</li>
<li>Mouse cursor high DPI issues still unresolved for applications such as <em>Firefox</em> or <em>Spotify</em> (I use Chrome so that is less of a concern to me).</li>
</ul>
<h6>The good:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Hardware is fully supported (who remembers the days when you had to figure out whey the sound is not working?)</li>
<li><em>X11</em> works great, no more half-working Wayland.</li>
<li><em>KDE</em> works great.</li>
<li>Battery lasts as it should.</li>
<li>No crashes so farm, even with all my tinkering.</li>
<li>High DPI is better than in 16.04.</li>
<li>Most of the stuff can be fixed if you follow Google!</li>
<li>It is getting better.</li>
</ul>
<h6>I will keep trying to improve my experience in the next weeks. But, so far, these are some of the articles that helped me:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Enable <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/Hibernate">hibernation </a><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/768136/how-can-i-hibernate-on-ubuntu-16-04">using</a> <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file">uswsusp</a>.</li>
<li>Fix the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/broadcom-sta/+bug/1765036">Wi-Fi issues</a> after resume.</li>
<li>Enable the High DPI settings for <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SDDM">SDDM</a> (DPI of 192 is the best for XPS&#8217;s monitor).</li>
<li>More <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI">High DPI</a> <a href="http://www.lorenzobettini.it/2016/07/hidpi-in-kde-plasma/">tweaks</a>.</li>
<li>And, tweaks and <a href="https://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-18-04/">packages</a> you can install afterwards.</li>
<li>Whoops, Gnome sucks, now install <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/919193/new-to-ubuntu-how-to-install-kubuntu">Kubuntu</a>.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it has been years (<strong>apparently no less than four!</strong>). Since my last post a lot has changed for me in particular, and, in tech at large.</p>
<p>So why hasn&#8217;t Alex been blogging one might <strong>not</strong> ask, and be forgiven. Well, let me explain and rant a little bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I have no more connection to the Delphi community for a number of reasons, most prominent being that I do not have a license and I am not willing to purchase one just to have some fun. All my open-source projects are .NET these days (incidentally, check out my <a href="https://github.com/pavkam">GitHub</a>) since Microsoft &#8220;<em>graciously</em>&#8221; offers a community edition of Visual Studio.<br />
Given that I have no idea what is going on in the world of Delphi, I have not progressed beyond my feelings of disappointment in the horrible quality of the compiler, mediocre support for cool new language features and etc.</li>
<li>Given the previous long rant, one can understand why I have stopped writing anything about Delphi.</li>
<li>I moved on to <em>.NET</em>.</li>
<li>The advent of &#8220;<em>stack overflow programming</em>&#8221; paradigm (also know as &#8220;<em>just google it</em>&#8220;) ate most of the topics I could talk about.</li>
<li>And finally, I got older and I started caring more about project architecture rather than small implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here I am, and ready to start anew. I am not yet sure what is my next post going to be about, but I hope to have something interesting to write about, things that people might be interested in.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Some older posts might resurface in the next days due to me fixing and updating up my WordPress installation.</em></p>
