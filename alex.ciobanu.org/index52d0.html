					<description><![CDATA[Documentation feedback is very important in any company&#039;s attempt to reach out to and connect with their customers. Ultimately, IMO, the onus needs to be on the company to make it as easy as possible for users to submit feedback. Finding ways to let the user be less specific is actually a good thing, because it further reduces the need for users to spend a lot of time writing feedback. A recent post of mine might be of interest: http://blog.lugiron.com/2009/05/documentation-feedback-dont-ask-if-you-dont-care/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Dino - shame that no one in the high management actually reads these mails so your point of view is unnoticed by the people who can actually take a conclusion from your mail.

@Max - better wait for Update 2 to come out (nearing).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Be specific. Emails that say “all the help is bad” are discarded immediately&quot;

&quot;Mails that simply praise Delphi 7 help and nothing more are discarded&quot;

Within the confines of what you are trying to achieve (putting lipstick on pigs?) I can understand both your sensitivity and the request for specific information. 

However the Help system as supplied with D2009 is one of the reasons why my company has made the decision to abandon Delphi as a programming tool and I would have thought that should be of interest to you, even though it is unspecific. It is one of several steps backward that have changed Delphi from RAD to SAD.

Less is sometimes more.]]></description>
