					<description><![CDATA[It took me a good 1 year to change our codebase in the past (when 2009 was released) to replace all string buffers for TBytes.

Its a huge amount of work but its worth it.. I didn&#039;t want to &quot;ansify&quot; my code by changing string to AnsiString to keep using it as data buffer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Using strings as buffers for binary data should have been abandoned when dynamic arrays were introduced. Oh, I know there is no Pos or concatenation for dynarrays, but if everyone had converted to them, and the demand had been there, someone (probably Borland) would have written those. Or one could have written them oneself.

In other words: I have absolutely no remorse for those who got in trouble when strings became 16-bit based because they used strings as binary buffers. They had some 15 years (or more?) to do the right thing and didn&#039;t.]]></description>
