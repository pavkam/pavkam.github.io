					<description><![CDATA[Interesting approach. I use something similar for access of column values of a SQL query in our classes.
The DispInvoke procedure default implementation is quite slow.
If you want to have your aVariant.Method resolution made faster, you can see what I&#039;ve written at http://blog.synopse.info/post/2011/07/01/Faster-variant-late-binding]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any chance of a DeHL 0.85 build soon ? 

No major changes..

Just the DeHL collection section removed, with any Collection.Base etc usage to now use the Collections 1.1.1 ?

Just makes things a little cleaner not having 2 sets of collections included.

Thanks
Andrew]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It sound good but the RTTI is still quite limited and will not allow (without ugly runtime code generation) full AOP-like wizardry. The guys from Spring for Delphi will absolutely benefit for such features.

My dream is to to be able to easily create in Delphi (like in Java, .NET ...etc) the following &quot;artifacts&quot;: 
- proxies for interfaces and non-final classes 
- easy mocks 
- easy BDD
- AOP aspects
- easy/on-demand dynamic loading/unloading for packages (sort of class loading but at the &quot;assembly&quot; level as done in .NET)

Is definitely true that Delphi (even being native !) had closures before Java (due to 2012/Java 8) but will be good to have some additional feature-stealing in Delphi from other modern languages. 

I&#039;m not a fun of LINQ type of features ... but looking into Scala (traits, extended generics/self-types, pattern matching, actors, easy DSLs, parallel support) ... should give anybody a clear look of what I mean. BTW: LINQ type of features can be implemented as internal DSLs. 

Hopefully the compiler guys (Barry &#038; co) are looking into these also to benefit long-term the Delphinians arena :)]]></description>
