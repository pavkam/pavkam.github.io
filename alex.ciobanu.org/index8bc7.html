					<description><![CDATA[@Dmitry, yes, if you filter by *.xml you will miss some files. I will update the code
As for full path - I don&#039;t think it is required since you can do it in the loop:

for S in TDirectory.Entries(’C:’, ‘*.xml’, True) do
  FileName := &#039;C:&#039; + S;

... this way the function is more generic in it&#039;s functionality. Returning the full path may not be welcome by everybody. But I&#039;ll think about it.

@Ted -- I can&#039;t, it will break the actual beaty since you would have to enumerate using some structure:

var
  a: TEnumStruct;
begin

for a in TDirectory.Entries(&#039;c:&#039;) do
  WriteLn(a.FileSize);

... which is not a bad idea but requires another special function + enumerator]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, Alex!

How to get a list of all files with the extension xml?
When the code is called 
for S in TDirectory.Entries(&#039;C:&#039;, &#039;*.xml&#039;, True)
then nothing is as folder &#039;*.xml&#039; does not exist.

This is a bug?

Maybe make two sets of masks - and for folders and files ?

P.S. 	Again, sorry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, Alex!
Thank you for your wonderful work!
Regarding FSEnum would like to invite to make a replacement 
function TDirectory.TEnumerator.GetCurrent: String;
begin
   Result: = FCurrent;
end;
for 
function TDirectory.TEnumerator.GetCurrent: String;
begin
  Result: = FPath + FCurrent;
end;
to derive the full path.

Sincerely, Dmitry.
P.S. Sorry for the bad english, because I used Google Translate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LINQ in C# is not only syntactic glue. Not to mention you need anonymous types types, nullables, lambdas (both in Code and in generated AST in EXE). And not to forget you need to cleanup the intermediary resources. While I was able to use interfaces a lot in DeHL to obtain this chaining with auto cleanup, there may be problems that could not be solved this way.

Not saying it&#039;s impossible but is it really worth it? I would settle for proper lambdas and optionally anonymous types ... the rest can be done through library calls.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Alex -&#062; That is just syntatic glue.  A complete resign of the compiler is just FUD.  Once you find the keyword that indicates LINQ syntax statement, you just run down a different parse tree.

The harder part are the underlying libraries that truely make up LINQ.  The syntax is just translates to a series of librarie class that use lambda expressions and type inference and nullable types.

The libraries need to be written (and/or possibly licensed), and type inteference added to the language -which would be a plus in many ways (yes, some will abuse it, but that is the case for any technology feature) as would nullable types (variants are nice, but slow).

Sorry, I appear to have hijacked your post to a different topic.   I just really like what Linq has to offer and directory searching has always been one of my idea cases for arguing that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is one area that Linq like features would make even better in my mind.

In fact, the directory tree diving would be a major benefit there as well.

From SearchTree(&#039;I:\&#039;,True) Select Filename,Size Where ((Attribute and faDirectory)=0) And Size&#062;1024*10 Into MyFileSet Order By Filename;

Would be really nice to be able to type in.

I do keep hoping with all the new emphasis on R&#038;D at Embarawhastzit that they&#039;ll get into Linq sooner than later.]]></description>
