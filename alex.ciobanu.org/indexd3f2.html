					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Akismet is doing a good job for me too. So far 0 missed and only 1 false positive. Reminded me that I had to go there and have a look. Found 30 spams trapped and waiting to be deleted....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My spamfilter reports an average of 59 spams / day, I don&#039;t have daily stats though.
Very few spams get through (maybe once a week at worst)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since I&#039;m using my own blog engine (still written in RAD Studio 2007 with ECO), I wrote my own spam filter which filters a few dozen comments each day. Mainly comments that point to other websites and/or use &quot;special&quot; words from a blacklist that I&#039;ve been compiling (based on decreasing &quot;success&quot; of comments that passed the filter). There&#039;s a slight chance I may block a valid comment, but only if it would use these words (and a mention of a &quot;sexy&quot; application would not be reason to kill it, neither would be a normal reference to a website).
It seems to be a &quot;battle&quot; or &quot;game&quot; between the spambots and me - sometimes they come up with something that will &quot;pass&quot; (for a little while), but I can always manually remove comments, of course. That needs to be done about once a week nowadays...]]></description>
