					<description><![CDATA[The situation was much worse before the 2010 release. But I managed to create good test cases of the guys to use when fixing  the IDE/compiler.

There is a problem in the compiler that prevents it to properly compile generics when circular dependencies are found. And apparently there&#039;s nothing that can be done about that with the current compiler architecture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Finally someone who shares my experience when working with code that contains generics. I cannot remember how often either my IDE freezes or I get some internal compiler error which only can be resolved by restarting the IDE.

As for the changes I like the renaming of TEnexCollection to TSequence ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Turn off error insight and the symbol insight, however is called the thing that provides symbol info when the mouse hovers a symbol. They must leak or corrupt memory when operating on incorrect code (and code is almost always incorrect when you&#039;re editing it), and after sometime, you just get random crashes in the IDE.

For generics size, well, not much to do IME beyond keeping your generics as small as possible, and/or have them be only thin wrappers against non-generic containers whenever feasible.
Using generics everywhere quickly leads your executables into dozens of megabytes for relatively simple stuff...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still using XE, still happy :)
I agree about the lambdas though. Right now I&#039;m doing a little project in C#, and I enjoy using lambdas, LINQ, persisting any object graph to a human-readable file with no extra work, not having to make up object ownership graphs etc.]]></description>
