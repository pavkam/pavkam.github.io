					<description><![CDATA[Hi JamesJ,

Unfortunately I do not have the luxury of time nor do I have enough space to keep more than one distro installed.

In the end I decided to stay with 7.10 and recompile all new versions of software I need that Ubuntu would not update anymore for me. Will skip a few versions just to be sure there is progress :)

Thanks for your comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had no problems with 8.04, but I hasten to add I waited at least two months before installing it. Since I started using Linux, I have tried multiple distributions, and always cycle back to Ubuntu.  As for your comment &quot;Why is everybody pushing the ‚Äútesting‚Äù itself onto us users? &quot; I think that is quite all right since it gives thousands of people a chance to voice their opinion. It allows us all to be involved. And to conclude, with respect to your statement &quot;For example show the user the old components (stable) and the new ones (experimental). Let the user select which component he wants to use.&quot; , I keep 8.04 installed in one partition with the latest Ubuntu dis installed in a different partition. This allows me to check out the newest while retaining the old, and if necessary revert back easily.
I did enjoy your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Michael

Yes, well my comments are basically &quot;bashing&quot; Ubuntu&#039;s policy. Also ... the times when I actually loved hacking through config files and and trying out new stuff are gone. Just wanted to try a distribution people call &quot;best&quot;. I guess I should think again.

Thanks for the tip. Will have to try out slack sometimes.

@slacker

That is the entire point. They tested those only in a few circumstances. I heard it was fixed later on, but since there&#039;s no Wi-Fi I can&#039;t check it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[although I can see your objection to pulseaudio as being valid, (I always remove it completely on any new 8.04 install) I have to say that GVFS has been an absolute blessing. For me at least it has worked flawlessly and saved me a lot of headaches and I cannot comment on the wifi because my IPW3945 worked perfectly out of the box on both 7.10 and 8.04. 

All in all I have found 8.04 to be a very solid release and I&#039;m very happy with it. It&#039;s a shame it didn&#039;t work out so well for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wifi has always been a tough hurdle for the *nix&#039;s. Its a whole lot better, but its not perfect.
If you like linux and but dont like the crap that happens when you update, I reccomend two things:
1. Keep a record of everything you did to get modules to work in a certain release, and be active in the wikis, so you can keep a handle on solutions. ubuntu forums is great about that.
2. If you want to keep using linux and you get your nerd on a little more, go one of two different philosophies: use a more conservative distro, such as slackware, or use a distro with no major releases, such as foresight, arch, or etc. Arch is bleeding edge, so things might break more, but they&#039;ll (probably) be smaller breaks, if that makes any sense. I know of quite a few people who had one or two small things break when they updated ubuntu to 8.04. 

Afterall, its all about package management.]]></description>
