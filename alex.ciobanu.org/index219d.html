					<description><![CDATA[Alex:
OK, a little out of sequence here, but here we go:
2. TDictionary can actually free the object if you need. And if you derive from TBucketList you could do it too. No sweat. This is a fantastic solution is a far larger number of likely circumstances because the memory and performance penalty is almost neglible. In one example I have, items can be associated with one another in a number of possible ways. I do this with a couple of dictionaries so you can find objects by key or association (parent, child, whatever).

Your responses in 1 and 3: Your disagreement basically stems from the case you discuss, namely associate data with ANY object, be it a button, dataset field component, business object, object to calculate control layout for a form and so on. My point in paragraph 2 was actually that this is a fairly esoteric case - it may be applicable in one case, but in the vast majority you&#039;ll want to associate a given class of object with another. Like a business object with a list item for example. In instances where the one object cannot be changed by you (say the list item I mentioned) my solution works like a treat. The class helper may cause trouble if you use many of them, but for the general case it is going to be just fine. Your&#039;s is a neat solution for the esoteric case and a cool technical achievement, but it is not so widely applicable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. No class helpers - that is a must in a lot of circumstances.
2. Dictionary doesn&#039;t cut it either since you need to destroy the attached object when the object dies. In this case you must handle it manually and that is a very big disadvantage.
3. You must use TObject and only it. Since in many cases you cannot change the original code.

In these circumstances there is no other alternative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Or you could forego all this trouble by simply storing your object and its associated data in a TDictionary (or TBucketList descendant). A class helper can make it appear to be a property on TObject.

Actually, given that TObject with extra data is almost always an indication that you really need a more specialised thing, just do the TDictionary and class helper for that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Patrick: Sorry, I actually was going to mention your name but I decided to not include it since maybe you would not want that (privacy?). Anyway, I have updated the post and specified your name and the original author&#039;s name.

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Por el comentario, creo deducir que el cÃ³digo fuente y la idea no coresponden al autor dela entrada. Pido excusas si es asÃ­ pero no he encontrado referencias en la lectura que hice de la misma. Ahora he leido el comentario mas abajo citado y bien, queda mi rectificaciÃ³n. :-)

Ok.

Un saludo.


//Thorsten Engler propsed a (IMHO) small modification to this construct (he coined //the word â€˜ObjectExtensionâ€™), which would make it possible that any data could //be added to TObject (even at runtime). This would open up the way to let //â€˜aspectsâ€™ add data to any class too (!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for writing this out - I&#039;ll be studying your implementation with interest!
But I do think you should have mentioned my name (and Thorsten&#039;s), instead of just mentioning &#039;someone&#039;. Shrug. For those interested, here&#039;s where this idea surfaced : http://alex.ciobanu.org/?p=215#comment-328]]></description>
