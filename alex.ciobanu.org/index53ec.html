								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will start by saying that that I do not have anything new to add to the everlasting &#8220;<em>dynamic vs static binding</em>&#8221; debate: It&#8217;s been talked about to death at this point, and yeah, I am still well in the &#8220;<em>strongly typed languages</em>&#8221; camp and am not planning to leave anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>But that is not the point of this post.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a secret that I have been deeply entrenched into .NET for almost a decade now. But, only in the last couple of years I actually started enjoying all the new features to the .NET run-time and C# language language. <em>Anonymous objects</em>, <em>the dynamic language run-time</em>, value tuples, <em>async</em> and of course extensive <em>type inference</em> are just a few of them.</p>
<p>The biggest, shift for me personally, happened when I stopped caring/worrying about the &#8220;shape of data&#8221; I was using during the programming process. I know &#8212; sounds so vague that even I am not comfortable with this explanation What I mean is the fact that in a lot of cases, now, I do not have to care about the data type more than I need to. The compiler does take a lot of the grunt work out of the equation and leaves me to worry about the truly important things.</p>
<p>On the data and serialization side, I switched to <em>JSON</em> entirely. Popular libraries in .NET, combined with the <em>DLR</em> make object serialization a breeze. Instead of a ton of boilerplate types that never actually add any value, it&#8217;s a matter of using dynamic objects instead.</p>
<p><strong>A quite lazy example</strong>, but illustrates somewhat my point:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate">
...
dynamic request = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(buffer);
...
var (result, details) = ProcessRequest(request);
...
</pre>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>C# is definitely not a dynamic language</strong>, but it does borrow interesting concepts quite well and that gives people like me a pleasant and &#8220;<em>safe</em>&#8221; environment to work with.</p>
