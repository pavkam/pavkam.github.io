					<description><![CDATA[Hi Patrick,

Yes, the interface in a record is now widely used to get hold of operator overloading on non-classes. The only bad thing in that is the fact that a lot of &quot;back-stage&quot; calls are being inserted by the compiler.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this detailed explanation - information on this is rather hard to come by.

In my latest attempt in creating my own data type (an alternative for the &#039;string&#039; type, called &#039;rope&#039; - google for a definition), I quickly got stuck with all sorts of details while implementing a custom Variant. So in the end, I ditched the variant-stuff, and settled for a record with a few operator overloads. This turned out to be much easier.

I used a record with just 1 private data member (an interface) and a few operator overloaders (namely the add operator, plus implicit and explicit casts). The interface has only 1 function - returning the interface implementor. The record operators are redirected to the actual implementations in this instance.

This construction allows to use my type as a stack-managed type, but still has the advantages of a reference-counted interface-type. (I couldn&#039;t use interfaces directly, as these are heap-managed, and don&#039;t support operator overloads).

Who knows - maybe this helps someone?  - If it does, gimme a call ;-)]]></description>
