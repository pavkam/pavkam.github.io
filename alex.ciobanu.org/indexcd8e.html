					<description><![CDATA[There seems to be a bug somewhere, either in the database or in your extraction code.  All the &#039;offset&#039; values for GMT+x and GMT-x in the table are values in minutes, for example 60, 120, 180.  But this field should contain the offset in seconds, and does for almost all the other entries that I have so far checked.  See the definition of CZone_307_Arr for an example.  The result is a four-minute time change when I call ToLocalTime for GMT-4, instead of four hours.

There are one or two other errors, such as a value of 300 for Cairo before 1900, and -70200 for Casablanca before 1913; but I do not need the historical data. In fact I would really like to have an option for the program that creates the .INC file, to include only data for years from the current year forward.

I have fixed this for now by editing the INC file, but you may want to check the extraction code.]]></description>
