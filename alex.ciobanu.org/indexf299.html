					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I got older&quot; is a common way to express the &quot;I changed&quot; statement. 

There is no praise high enough that I would not bestow upon Delphi. It was ahead of its time for so long... It could have continued to be so, but ... it did not. 

And finally, one cannot even use it unless one pays. There is no open source or free compiler provided by the owner company. I *can&#039;t event try* to use it for non-profit projects.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to rain on your party, but I keep reading such statements in various places and it gets tiresome.

&quot;I got older&quot; (age is not related, you mean you changed) and the rant about Delphi are annoying. .NET has it&#039;s own set of quirks and also advantages.

I have more diversified interests as well. Just talk about the new, and don&#039;t diss the past.

Have fun with your future projects and enjoy the change.]]></description>
