								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah &#8230; seriously! Tried to move away from the TMainMenu in Eduka+ today. Spent nearly 3 hours researching and trying out different approaches to make the Action based menu work&#8230; It seriously lacks clarity and functionality.</p>
<p>So what do I find wrong with it? Well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of normal documentation and samples to clarify the usage in some cases.</li>
<li>Lack of functions to control the items directly without much hassle. I&#8217;d love to see something like: SetEnabled(Action, Boolean) or SetVisible for example. That would have made moving from TMainMenu oh so much more pleasant.</li>
<li>Why the hell the whole menu/sub-menu would not disable when I disable the associated action? Even if the menu looks disabled I can still navigate to it and see it&#8217;s sub-actions there activated. I can even execute them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway &#8230; will have to continue next days.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eduka+ is one of my pet projects I&#8217;ve been working on a very long time ago (started 5 years ago I think). The Idea was to create a replacement for 2 programs used in Moldavian schools to teach children the basics of programming. Of course, being a pet project it grew beyond just that, incorporating a good help system, cool artwork (thanks Ion Popov for that) and many more functions. After 2 years of updates it pretty much stalled &#8211; until this week. There were some interests in this program so I was quickly motivated to produce some binaries to be distributed. I hit some problems along the way of course:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is horribly horribly written! I can&#8217;t even wonder how did I come up with such code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Because of 1 there seem to be some problems on multi-core machines. The application is not really thread-safe but it works on one core pretty well.</li>
<li>It was written in Delphi 7 and depended on some 3rd party components that made translating to a newer version of Delphi quite a hurdle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixing the code is a no-no because I do not have the time nor the interest to do that which leaves us with threading problems. I did manage to hack-solve them by issuing <em>SetProcessAffinityMask()</em> calls to specifically tell windows to use one single CPU for the application. And for the 3rd party packages &#8211; Ion managed to remove the dependency on <em>JEDI </em>package (which provided replacements for the standard components) and I made it so that <em>SynEdit </em>package would not require to be installed as a component anymore.</p>
<p>All that actually revived Eduka+ and made it possible to build it on Delphi 10 (well with a little fixing of course).</p>
<p>There is a Google Code project for Eduka+ now (GPLv3) which you can find <a href="http://code.google.com/p/eduka/">here</a>. We hope to release a final version 1.7 very soon and actually finish what we have started!</p>
<p>Enjoy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
