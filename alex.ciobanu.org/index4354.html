								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once every N years I give Linux a try. I&#8217;ve been a great supporter in the past and I always enjoyed tinkering with my OSes. I gradually lost the appetite due to jobs always requiring a windows PC, making the use of Linux a pain.</p>
<p>For my previous attempt to use Linux, in the summer of 2017, I used my Dell XPS 13 (9350) machine. This model is touted by Dell and Ubuntu as &#8220;<em>Linux developer friendly</em>&#8220;. I used an <strong>Ubuntu 16.04</strong> as my distribution of choice. In short &#8212; I was disappointed. Nothing was working properly, the system was crashing and overheating. I gave up after a couple of days.</p>
<p>Well, since it has been a year, time for another try &#8211; this time using <strong>Ubuntu 18.04</strong>. It&#8217;s been a week so far and <strong>I am still using it</strong>, which says a lot (for me at least).</p>
<h6>The bad:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Wayland was not fixed, but simply, not used.</li>
<li>The default session is based on Gnome 3, which is buggy and slow. CPU usage on minimal interaction was extremely high. Even things like <em>glxgears</em> was jerky every few seconds.</li>
<li>Hibernation needs to be enabled manually, and a lot of Googling has to be done prior to that point.</li>
<li>Mouse cursor high DPI issues still unresolved for applications such as <em>Firefox</em> or <em>Spotify</em> (I use Chrome so that is less of a concern to me).</li>
</ul>
<h6>The good:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Hardware is fully supported (who remembers the days when you had to figure out whey the sound is not working?)</li>
<li><em>X11</em> works great, no more half-working Wayland.</li>
<li><em>KDE</em> works great.</li>
<li>Battery lasts as it should.</li>
<li>No crashes so farm, even with all my tinkering.</li>
<li>High DPI is better than in 16.04.</li>
<li>Most of the stuff can be fixed if you follow Google!</li>
<li>It is getting better.</li>
</ul>
<h6>I will keep trying to improve my experience in the next weeks. But, so far, these are some of the articles that helped me:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Enable <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/Hibernate">hibernation </a><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/768136/how-can-i-hibernate-on-ubuntu-16-04">using</a> <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file">uswsusp</a>.</li>
<li>Fix the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/broadcom-sta/+bug/1765036">Wi-Fi issues</a> after resume.</li>
<li>Enable the High DPI settings for <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SDDM">SDDM</a> (DPI of 192 is the best for XPS&#8217;s monitor).</li>
<li>More <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI">High DPI</a> <a href="http://www.lorenzobettini.it/2016/07/hidpi-in-kde-plasma/">tweaks</a>.</li>
<li>And, tweaks and <a href="https://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-18-04/">packages</a> you can install afterwards.</li>
<li>Whoops, Gnome sucks, now install <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/919193/new-to-ubuntu-how-to-install-kubuntu">Kubuntu</a>.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided to use GNU/Linux once again (after 3 years of pause). Installed Ubuntu 7.10 and configured all the stuff like I was used to a few years back. I was really amazed that my wireless card was supported and that Ubuntu shipped the requited kernel module to toggle my Wi-Fi kill-switch (bash script required). Everything was just fine until I decided to switch to Ubuntu 8.04.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t start blogging about the suckiness of that release particularly, I will rather concentrate on the model in which all GNU/Linux distributions are &#8220;evolving&#8221;: Why, o why are distributions including experimental and untested software in their new releases? Why is everybody pushing the &#8220;testing&#8221; itself onto us users? How can the distribution be considered stable and evolving if the next release is worse then the previous?</p>
<p>To detaliate on the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken Wi-Fi. The old (non-free) drivers for my Intel card were working perfectly in 7.10. They decided to replace them with an experimental OSS driver from Intel. My internet is coming through a wi-fi link so how can I download the back ports of the old driver?</li>
<li>Broken Gnome VFS. Yeah, they decided the old (working) implementation was rather bad so they started a rewrite. I completely agree but why include the new implementation which wasn&#8217;t even tested properly?</li>
<li>Broken Sound. I know PulseAudio is the new standard (and pretty cool) sound-card daemon. But why include it by default when it&#8217;s not yet stable? Probably many users are quite happy with it, but in my case (as in many others) it completely messed up the whole &#8220;Linux experience&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why not have a new system configuration module for this things? For example show the user the old components (stable) and the new ones (experimental). Let the user select which component he wants to use. One can select the &#8220;New Sound System&#8221; over the &#8220;Stable Sound System&#8221; and check if it works the way one wants it to work. If it has problems, revert back to the old module. That way I could have simply selected &#8220;Old Intel Wi-Fi drivers&#8221; and continue with my work. That is the fair way! This would also prevent thousands of posts all over the internet stating &#8220;Ubuntu 8.04 sucks&#8221;.</p>
<p>This post can probably be applied to any &#8220;bleeding-edge&#8221; distributions out there with ease (like Fedora).</p>
