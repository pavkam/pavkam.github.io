								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mid-2018, after quite some time spent in C# and Azure lands I decided it was time for a change. The next job, I said to myself, is going to have at least one new tech element to it. So, early in 2019 I joined a new company called <a href="https://www.jet.com">Jet.com</a>.<em> [You can find some amazing blog posts written by my colleagues at the <a href="https://medium.com/jettech">Jet Tech Blog</a>.]</em></p>
<p>The things that attracted me at Jet were the <a href="https://stackshare.io/jet-com/jet-com">tech stack</a> and the scale. I finally got to use a functional language such asÂ <strong>F#</strong> in production. To be completely honest, before this position, functional languages always seemed like a niche to me. Besides, languages like C# have ingested a lot of functional features to make them better. <em>As you might expect, 3 months in, my views are starting to change</em>.</p>
<p>So what did I learn in the last months and what do I think about F#? That&#8217;s my list so far (guaranteed to be revised in another 3 months!):</p>
<ul>
<li>For a person grown on Pascal and C-like languages, F# syntax looks odd for the first &#8220;<em>many</em>&#8221; weeks. It takes time to adjust to the Python-like indentation-based blocks. The presence of the &#8220;<em>{ }</em>&#8221; brackets is confusing since they are used for quite a few things including &#8220;<em>async</em>&#8221; code.</li>
<li>F# is multi-paradigm language on top of .NET. That makes it support things such as classes, for loops and other &#8220;<em>not entirely function things</em>&#8220;. You can write imperative code in F#. It will look ugly as hell, but you can do it.</li>
<li>Type inference is crazy! Most of the time you can get away with using a type on anything. C# is seems like a half-baked potato compared to its sibling. The downside becomes apparent when trying to refactor code. One small change in a one function can lead to hundreds of compilation errors as the type inference starts deciding values and arguments have different types.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s all .NET stack so the hard learning curve that one would expect is non a thing (if you come from other .NET languages).</li>
<li>Works like a charm on .NET Core and docker containers on Linux. [<em>Hard to imagine what Microsoft looks like these days isn&#8217;t it?!</em>]</li>
<li>I have not written one loop yet and I used a recursive function only once. Most of the sequence processing is done using the standard modules and function such as <code>Seq.map</code>.</li>
<li>Currying, partial application and other &#8220;<em>functions creating functions</em>&#8221; concepts are not hard to get around if you used C#&#8217;s lambdas and delegates for a while.</li>
<li>For a person like me that used to write assembler it is hard to let go to the micro-optimizations. One can always write more optimized hand-crafted imperative code. It still takes discipline for me not to drop those immutable <code>Maps</code> or <code>lists</code> in favor of their mutable counterparts. On the other hand, having default immutability on objects makes things much nicer.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just my first impressions and I do already sense there is some functionality that I wouldn&#8217;t be able t give up in the future!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently read <a href="https://michaelscodingspot.com/2018/07/30/where-did-the-microsoft-tech-stack-disappear/">this blog post</a> that looks at the current development stacks used by biggest startups &#8220;<em>out there</em>&#8220;. One thing becomes apparent: <strong>none of Microsoft&#8217;s tech is in any list</strong>.</p>
<p>To be honest this is not news to me or to anyone that pays attention to the state of affairs in the development world. The whole <em>.NET Core</em> strategy on Microsoft&#8217;s part is an effort to push mainly against <em>Node.js</em>. It is too early to say anything with certainty but it does look like Microsoft is a bit late (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and that&#8217;s an understatement</span>) to the party.</p>
<p>While I do tend to be language-agnostic these days (use Python and Node.js for a few projects), <strong>I do hope .NET Core gains some traction</strong> in the open source community. It&#8217;s quite an amazing technology, even if it&#8217;s Microsoft backed!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>P.S. There is an interesting process of polarization happening right now around me: the companies using the Microsoft stack are mostly leaning towards the financial sector, while the smaller ones (not necessarily startups) are mostly oriented towards the Open Source tooling/frameworks.</p>

		<title>On how I &#8220;started embracing&#8221; dynamic languages</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will start by saying that that I do not have anything new to add to the everlasting &#8220;<em>dynamic vs static binding</em>&#8221; debate: It&#8217;s been talked about to death at this point, and yeah, I am still well in the &#8220;<em>strongly typed languages</em>&#8221; camp and am not planning to leave anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>But that is not the point of this post.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a secret that I have been deeply entrenched into .NET for almost a decade now. But, only in the last couple of years I actually started enjoying all the new features to the .NET run-time and C# language language. <em>Anonymous objects</em>, <em>the dynamic language run-time</em>, value tuples, <em>async</em> and of course extensive <em>type inference</em> are just a few of them.</p>
<p>The biggest, shift for me personally, happened when I stopped caring/worrying about the &#8220;shape of data&#8221; I was using during the programming process. I know &#8212; sounds so vague that even I am not comfortable with this explanation What I mean is the fact that in a lot of cases, now, I do not have to care about the data type more than I need to. The compiler does take a lot of the grunt work out of the equation and leaves me to worry about the truly important things.</p>
<p>On the data and serialization side, I switched to <em>JSON</em> entirely. Popular libraries in .NET, combined with the <em>DLR</em> make object serialization a breeze. Instead of a ton of boilerplate types that never actually add any value, it&#8217;s a matter of using dynamic objects instead.</p>
<p><strong>A quite lazy example</strong>, but illustrates somewhat my point:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate">
...
dynamic request = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(buffer);
...
var (result, details) = ProcessRequest(request);
...
</pre>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>C# is definitely not a dynamic language</strong>, but it does borrow interesting concepts quite well and that gives people like me a pleasant and &#8220;<em>safe</em>&#8221; environment to work with.</p>

		<title>Introducing (very late!) XtraLiteTemplates for .NET (4.5+ and Core 2.0+)</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, to begin, this is not a new project &#8211; I have developed most of it during the end of 2015 with occasional fixes and new features along the way (recently added support for <em>DLR and dynamic objects</em>). But, in the great tradition of the &#8220;<em>blogger</em>&#8221; I feel obligated to share my baby with the world.</p>
<p>The project was born from a specific need we had at the company I was employed at the time: simplify email templates. You see, the templates were being kept by the developers as they were written using a tortured Razor engine (<em>yes, the same used by ASP.NET</em>). The amount of change requests coming in was, well, high. It became clear, we needed a simple way to allow non-technical staff to maintain the templates themselves &#8212; <strong>I know, sounds obvious, right!?</strong></p>
<p>I have considered different existing libraries to achieve this, including the beloved by all &#8220;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.replace(v=vs.110).aspx">String.Replace()</a>&#8221; method, but all options were either too simple to be useful or too complex to be used by non-techies. Nothing fit exactly into what we wanted. This prompted me to write the <a href="https://github.com/pavkam/XtraLiteTemplates">XtraLiteTemplates</a> library.</p>
<p>The core principles of the library are: <strong>must allow complex templates</strong> and <strong>must be usable by non-technical staff</strong>. Both are achieved by what I call &#8220;<em>domain-specific templates</em>&#8220;. The library allows a developer to define her own simple template language using existing constructs. Simply put you can define things like &#8220;<em>WHILE (expr) DO &#8230; END</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>DO (expr) IF (expr)</em>&#8220;. Or even something like &#8220;<em>PRICE OF (expr)</em>&#8220;. One can define any constructs that fit the business needs.</p>
<p>By default, the library comes with two &#8220;<em>dialects</em>&#8221; (the domain-specific languages): <a href="https://github.com/pavkam/XtraLiteTemplates/wiki/Standard-Dialect">Standard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pavkam/XtraLiteTemplates/wiki/Code-Monkey-Dialect">Code Monkey</a>. Code Monkey dialect if a super-set of the Standard and simplified constructs, aimed at developers). The following example shows a small use of the library:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate">
private static async Task MainAsync(string[] args)
{
    var @object = new
    {
        Name = &quot;Alex&quot;,
        Friends = new[] { &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Peter&quot; }
    };

    const string template = @&quot;
        {PRE}{person.Name} has {person.Friends.Length} friends: {FOR friend IN person.Friends}{friend}{WITH}, {END}.
        He is{IF person.Friends.Length == 0} not{END} a happy guy!{END}&quot;;

    var test = await XLTemplate.EvaluateAsync(
        CodeMonkeyDialect.Default,
        template,
        CancellationToken.None, person =&gt; @object).ConfigureAwait(false);

    Console.WriteLine(test);
}
</pre>
<p>Note that by default the engine removes additional white-spaces. To prevent that I used the &#8220;<em>PRE</em>&#8221; directive.</p>
<p>There is enough documentation in the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/pavkam/XtraLiteTemplates/wiki">wiki</a> so I am not going to repeat it here. Hope this project helps someone in need of a simple but powerful template library (<em>no, String.Replace is not an option!</em>).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post (<a href="http://alex.ciobanu.org/?p=674">&#8220;Singleton&#8221; Azure Functions</a>) I offered a tip on how to set up an Azure function to serve as a system-wide &#8220;singleton&#8221;. One of the use cases I was looking for was to set up a service to act as a &#8220;<em>broker between two Service Bus queues</em>&#8220;. I will not go into details, suffice to say, there is a requirement to only allow, let&#8217;s say, 100 messages per second to pass through the queue.</p>
<p>As I am a strong proponent of &#8220;<em>less talk, more code</em>&#8221; so here is a rough version that gets the job done:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate">
private static readonly SemaphoreSlim _semaphore = new new SemaphoreSlim(1, 1);
private static readonly QueueClient _outputQueueClient = new QueueClient(&quot;{connection string}&quot;);
private static double _nextDispatchAt;
private const double _rate = 100; // the rate!

/* Method creates a task scheduled to run approximately 
   at a given &quot;time&quot; */
private static Task MoveMessageToOutputQueue(Message message) 
{ 
    Contract.Assert(message != null);

    /* Get a lock to make sure _nextDispatchAt is modified 
       atomically. This is a lazy implementation but it does the job. */
    _semaphore.Wait(); 
    try 
    { 
        /* Calculate the next &quot;click&quot;. */
        var now = DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks; 
        var delta = _nextDispatchAt - now; 
        var click = TimeSpan.TicksPerMillisecond * (1000 / _rate); 
        if (delta &gt; 0) 
        { 
            /* We need to wait until the next dispatch. */ 
            var millisToWait = (_nextDispatchAt - now) / TimeSpan.TicksPerMillisecond; 
            _nextDispatchAt += click;

            /* If the number of ticks is below the millisecond 
               threshold, execute directly. */
            return millisToWait &gt; 0 ?
                Task.Delay((int)millisToWait).ContinueWith(t =&gt; _outputQueueClient.SendAsync(message)) :
                _outputQueueClient.SendAsync(message);
        }
        else 
        {
            /* The execution is direct as there is no waiting time. */ 
            _nextDispatchAt = now + click; 
            return _outputQueueClient.SendAsync(message);
        } 
    } 
    finally 
    { 
        _semaphore.Release();
    }
}

/* This is the actual Azure function which is set up to listen on the &quot;input-queue&quot; */
[FunctionName(nameof(MoveMessageFromInputToOutput))]
public static async Task MoveMessageFromInputToOutput(
[ServiceBusTrigger(&quot;input-queue&quot;)] Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.BrokeredMessage message, 
TraceWriter log)
{
    Contract.Assert(message != null);
    Contract.Assert(log != null);
    log.Debug($&quot;Moving incoming message with label \&quot;{message.Label}\&quot; ...&quot;);

    /* Make a copy of the message (just the body and whatever fields are interesting). */
    Message outputMessage;
    using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
    {
        await message.GetBody&lt;Stream&gt;().CopyToAsync(ms).ConfigureAwait(false);
        outputMessage = new Message(ms.ToArray())
        {
            Label = message.Label,
            ContentType = message.ContentType
        };
    }

    await MoveMessageToOutputQueue(outputMessage).ConfigureAwait(false);
}
</pre>
<p>To make sure the higher rates are handled, and that the function does not starve, one can update the <em>host.json</em> as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
{
    &quot;serviceBus&quot;: {
        &quot;maxConcurrentCalls&quot;: 32, // Threads will mostly be awaiting
        &quot;prefetchCount&quot;: 256 // The more the merrier
    }
}
</pre>
<p>After some testing it turns out that the rate limiter is almost perfect on &#8220;<em>low rates</em>&#8221; such as <strong>100 messages/second</strong>. Due limitations of the Service Bus and other factors this code <strong>will not surpass ~600 messages/second</strong>. In such cases, multiple instances of the rate limiter should be deployed, and dividing the load between them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not the sort of &#8220;stuff&#8221; I would usually be writing about in the past. Lately, though, more and more work that I am involved with is somewhat related toÂ <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>. More often than not, my daily tasks include bending Azure services to my needs rather than writing code (which is a tediously philosophical discussion in itself!).</p>
<p>In one of our current projects, the architecture requires a number of &#8220;<em>singleton</em>&#8221; services to be connected to a shared service bus and regularly communicate with &#8220;<em>other services</em>&#8220;. In Azure terminology those singleton services would qualify asÂ <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs">Web Jobs</a>. Due to the current direction Microsoft is taking in regards to <a href="https://stackify.com/azure-webjobs-vs-azure-functions/">Azure Functions</a>, we have decided to go with them, rather than Web Jobs (not to mention it is much easier to deploy and monitor). All good and well so far, excluding a few annoyances here and there due to immature management Web UI.</p>
<p>One of the peculiar things that took some time to figure out, was how to set up a function to run as a singleton. It can be annoying to find exactly what needs to be done in tons of promotional material and blogs all focusing on the &#8220;<em>benefits of scaling out</em>&#8220;. In the unlikely event you&#8217;re trying to make sure your function app runs as singleton try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up your function app using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale">App Service plan</a>. Consumption plan gives Azure infrastructure all the power to move your app between machines or start up additional instances.</li>
<li>Make sure the &#8220;Always On&#8221; is toggled in Application Settings. Our singleton needs to be up an running at all times:<img class="size-full wp-image-675" style="font-weight: bold; background-color: transparent; color: #767676;" src="http://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp1.png" alt="Azure Function Always On" width="1050" height="110" srcset="https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp1.png 1050w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp1-300x31.png 300w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp1-768x80.png 768w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp1-1024x107.png 1024w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp1-80x8.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></li>
<li>Finally, one has to addÂ <em>WEBSITE_MAX_DYNAMIC_APPLICATION_SCALE_OUT</em> with a value of &#8220;1&#8221; to the Application Settings. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings">Do not ask</a>&#8230;<img class="size-full wp-image-676" src="http://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp2.png" alt="Azure Function Scaleout Setting" width="1899" height="105" srcset="https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp2.png 1899w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp2-300x17.png 300w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp2-768x42.png 768w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp2-1024x57.png 1024w, https://alex.ciobanu.org/files/uploads/2018/05/azp2-80x4.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1899px) 100vw, 1899px" /></li>

<p>Be aware, that using an App Service plan incurs additional costs, but I guess that is not different compared to attaching Seb Jobs to existing Web Applications.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it has been years (<strong>apparently no less than four!</strong>). Since my last post a lot has changed for me in particular, and, in tech at large.</p>
<p>So why hasn&#8217;t Alex been blogging one might <strong>not</strong> ask, and be forgiven. Well, let me explain and rant a little bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I have no more connection to the Delphi community for a number of reasons, most prominent being that I do not have a license and I am not willing to purchase one just to have some fun. All my open-source projects are .NET these days (incidentally, check out my <a href="https://github.com/pavkam">GitHub</a>) since Microsoft &#8220;<em>graciously</em>&#8221; offers a community edition of Visual Studio.<br />
Given that I have no idea what is going on in the world of Delphi, I have not progressed beyond my feelings of disappointment in the horrible quality of the compiler, mediocre support for cool new language features and etc.</li>
<li>Given the previous long rant, one can understand why I have stopped writing anything about Delphi.</li>
<li>I moved on to <em>.NET</em>.</li>
<li>The advent of &#8220;<em>stack overflow programming</em>&#8221; paradigm (also know as &#8220;<em>just google it</em>&#8220;) ate most of the topics I could talk about.</li>
<li>And finally, I got older and I started caring more about project architecture rather than small implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here I am, and ready to start anew. I am not yet sure what is my next post going to be about, but I hope to have something interesting to write about, things that people might be interested in.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Some older posts might resurface in the next days due to me fixing and updating up my WordPress installation.</em></p>

<p>A new version of TZDB has been release (1.8.2014b). This versionÂ fixes a few issues around the <em>Windows TZ aliases</em> provided by CLDR project. Obviously the database has been updated to the most recent version (<strong>2014b</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest news is the fact that we have moved to <a href="https://github.com/pavkam/tzdb">GitHub</a>! The old Google Code url will still be around for a while, after which point it will be deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would like to thank <strong>Pierre Yager</strong> for the fixes and the release itself as I do not have access to a Delphi license any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<address>TZDB is an open source project that provides Delphi (7+) and FreePascal (2.0+) users with a &#8220;built-in&#8221; timezone database. The same source of data is used in most Unixes, Java, MacOS and multiple other projects out there.</address>
