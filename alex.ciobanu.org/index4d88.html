Yeah i know, currently studying their source along with srp&#039;s protocol design (http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html) but just by looking in c++ code feel like i&#039;m damaging my brain cells more and more. :D I&#039;ll work it out tho, thanks for your reply (i wasn&#039;t expecting any since the topic&#039;s date is uhmm.. a years old? :P ) 

Keep up the hard work with your projects!]]></description>

Thanks for the kind words. 

To be honest I remember very little now about the actual code. I would suggest you head over to MangOS project home and download their sources. They have a working implementation of this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey there. 

I must comfess, pretty good story and information. I started yesterday a very simple server but, SRP-6 is killing me. For example, at the 1st server&#039;s parket reply (AuthLogonChallenge) we know the &quot;standard&quot; values: (00 00 00 [32] 01 07 20 [32] [32] [16] 00)
The second 32byte value is always the same.. but what about the first and third one? A description from a site says:

* 1st char[32] = Public ephemeral value (SRP)
* 2nd char[32] = A large safe prime (N = 2q+1, where q is prime). All arithmetic is done modulo N.(SRP) 
* 3rd char[32] = User&#039;s salt
(http://www.madx.dk/wowdev/wiki/index.php?title=Packets)

Also i&#039;ve found somewhere that the 16byte is a CRC.. seems like i still have to learn lots staff :(]]></description>
