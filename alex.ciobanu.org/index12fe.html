					<description><![CDATA[I am very excited to see what you have done! :)

I just wish there would be a way to reduce code size for generics. Not that it matters much (at least in my case) but binaries are growing pretty much if you have many generic types. Actually for all T that are classes that&#039;s just duplicated code. Last time I checked it was around 80K for every TList type in Collections.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The state of 2.0 is almost done code wise. I stopped because I realized it&#039;s just sick how much I have to write from the unit test perspective.

I will probably make a 2.0 beta release first which will not include unit tests and will release a final one when those tests are up.

2.0 is a major effort for me because I had removed a lot of duplicated code all over the place .
And introduced much more capable interfaces. The number of testable code paths grew a lot.

Expect a release soon (tm).

P.S. Oh man... I need to redo a lot of online docs and the interface diagram ...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess usable was the wrong word. It is more like the different people writing libraries that require all kinds of generic collection classes agree on using one version instead of &quot;reinventing&quot; them (and also in a very similar way if you compare spring4d and your implementation for example - actually these two are the only ones I know of that go that far).

In my case the state of collections was pretty much what I needed. In the dsharp code lists only need a very limited part of its functionality (no enex at all for example) while the consuming code that uses dsharp may make heavy use of such features.

I was thinking about using collections in dsharp but did not at the end because at that point I was not sure about the future development of it. Some parts (like the yield) can be enabled to work with collections by compiler switch.

In the implementations (which did not go that far) I made for dsharp I also tried to combine the non generic and the generic version of enumerable/enumerator/list and so on by using TValue for the non generic version since unfortunately the built-in interfaces (IEnumerable/IEnumerator and their generic versions) are not used in Generics.Collections and therefor not compatible with the classes in said unit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always liked the collections library and the way it introduced the linq like way of working with lists into delphi that was actually new to the majority of developers (unless they have been working with .Net already).

It would be nice if there could be a way of making Collections 2.0 something that is usable by other libraries (Spring4Delphi or DSharp for example since both have their own implementations of collection classes which gives you lot of problems if you are working with more than 1 of these libraries).]]></description>
