					<description><![CDATA[Get 1.7. I&#039;ve put my hands on a Delphi 7 in the mean time and was able to test it properly this time! Yey! Anyway, the fix was almost trivial, copy-pasted the whole IFDEF block after a line (ForEach needed some love too).

Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guess what... still doesn&#039;t works... all the conditional stuff alerts about constant errors. I try to fix it by removing the conditional block just to make it compiles under D7, then got some errors in a call to foreach. Again I try to fix it and got more errors, seems the calls are not the right ones. I stop there, mainly because I haven&#039;t the time to check, fix and recheck it. Hope this helps you to fix it.]]></description>
