								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently read <a href="https://michaelscodingspot.com/2018/07/30/where-did-the-microsoft-tech-stack-disappear/">this blog post</a> that looks at the current development stacks used by biggest startups &#8220;<em>out there</em>&#8220;. One thing becomes apparent: <strong>none of Microsoft&#8217;s tech is in any list</strong>.</p>
<p>To be honest this is not news to me or to anyone that pays attention to the state of affairs in the development world. The whole <em>.NET Core</em> strategy on Microsoft&#8217;s part is an effort to push mainly against <em>Node.js</em>. It is too early to say anything with certainty but it does look like Microsoft is a bit late (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and that&#8217;s an understatement</span>) to the party.</p>
<p>While I do tend to be language-agnostic these days (use Python and Node.js for a few projects), <strong>I do hope .NET Core gains some traction</strong> in the open source community. It&#8217;s quite an amazing technology, even if it&#8217;s Microsoft backed!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>P.S. There is an interesting process of polarization happening right now around me: the companies using the Microsoft stack are mostly leaning towards the financial sector, while the smaller ones (not necessarily startups) are mostly oriented towards the Open Source tooling/frameworks.</p>

		<title>On how I &#8220;started embracing&#8221; dynamic languages</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will start by saying that that I do not have anything new to add to the everlasting &#8220;<em>dynamic vs static binding</em>&#8221; debate: It&#8217;s been talked about to death at this point, and yeah, I am still well in the &#8220;<em>strongly typed languages</em>&#8221; camp and am not planning to leave anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>But that is not the point of this post.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a secret that I have been deeply entrenched into .NET for almost a decade now. But, only in the last couple of years I actually started enjoying all the new features to the .NET run-time and C# language language. <em>Anonymous objects</em>, <em>the dynamic language run-time</em>, value tuples, <em>async</em> and of course extensive <em>type inference</em> are just a few of them.</p>
<p>The biggest, shift for me personally, happened when I stopped caring/worrying about the &#8220;shape of data&#8221; I was using during the programming process. I know &#8212; sounds so vague that even I am not comfortable with this explanation What I mean is the fact that in a lot of cases, now, I do not have to care about the data type more than I need to. The compiler does take a lot of the grunt work out of the equation and leaves me to worry about the truly important things.</p>
<p>On the data and serialization side, I switched to <em>JSON</em> entirely. Popular libraries in .NET, combined with the <em>DLR</em> make object serialization a breeze. Instead of a ton of boilerplate types that never actually add any value, it&#8217;s a matter of using dynamic objects instead.</p>
<p><strong>A quite lazy example</strong>, but illustrates somewhat my point:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate">
...
dynamic request = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(buffer);
...
var (result, details) = ProcessRequest(request);
...
</pre>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>C# is definitely not a dynamic language</strong>, but it does borrow interesting concepts quite well and that gives people like me a pleasant and &#8220;<em>safe</em>&#8221; environment to work with.</p>
