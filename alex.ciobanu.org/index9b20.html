								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mid-2018, after quite some time spent in C# and Azure lands I decided it was time for a change. The next job, I said to myself, is going to have at least one new tech element to it. So, early in 2019 I joined a new company called <a href="https://www.jet.com">Jet.com</a>.<em> [You can find some amazing blog posts written by my colleagues at the <a href="https://medium.com/jettech">Jet Tech Blog</a>.]</em></p>
<p>The things that attracted me at Jet were the <a href="https://stackshare.io/jet-com/jet-com">tech stack</a> and the scale. I finally got to use a functional language such asÂ <strong>F#</strong> in production. To be completely honest, before this position, functional languages always seemed like a niche to me. Besides, languages like C# have ingested a lot of functional features to make them better. <em>As you might expect, 3 months in, my views are starting to change</em>.</p>
<p>So what did I learn in the last months and what do I think about F#? That&#8217;s my list so far (guaranteed to be revised in another 3 months!):</p>
<ul>
<li>For a person grown on Pascal and C-like languages, F# syntax looks odd for the first &#8220;<em>many</em>&#8221; weeks. It takes time to adjust to the Python-like indentation-based blocks. The presence of the &#8220;<em>{ }</em>&#8221; brackets is confusing since they are used for quite a few things including &#8220;<em>async</em>&#8221; code.</li>
<li>F# is multi-paradigm language on top of .NET. That makes it support things such as classes, for loops and other &#8220;<em>not entirely function things</em>&#8220;. You can write imperative code in F#. It will look ugly as hell, but you can do it.</li>
<li>Type inference is crazy! Most of the time you can get away with using a type on anything. C# is seems like a half-baked potato compared to its sibling. The downside becomes apparent when trying to refactor code. One small change in a one function can lead to hundreds of compilation errors as the type inference starts deciding values and arguments have different types.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s all .NET stack so the hard learning curve that one would expect is non a thing (if you come from other .NET languages).</li>
<li>Works like a charm on .NET Core and docker containers on Linux. [<em>Hard to imagine what Microsoft looks like these days isn&#8217;t it?!</em>]</li>
<li>I have not written one loop yet and I used a recursive function only once. Most of the sequence processing is done using the standard modules and function such as <code>Seq.map</code>.</li>
<li>Currying, partial application and other &#8220;<em>functions creating functions</em>&#8221; concepts are not hard to get around if you used C#&#8217;s lambdas and delegates for a while.</li>
<li>For a person like me that used to write assembler it is hard to let go to the micro-optimizations. One can always write more optimized hand-crafted imperative code. It still takes discipline for me not to drop those immutable <code>Maps</code> or <code>lists</code> in favor of their mutable counterparts. On the other hand, having default immutability on objects makes things much nicer.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just my first impressions and I do already sense there is some functionality that I wouldn&#8217;t be able t give up in the future!</p>
