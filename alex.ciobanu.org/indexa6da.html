					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I got older&quot; is a common way to express the &quot;I changed&quot; statement. 

There is no praise high enough that I would not bestow upon Delphi. It was ahead of its time for so long... It could have continued to be so, but ... it did not. 

And finally, one cannot even use it unless one pays. There is no open source or free compiler provided by the owner company. I *can&#039;t event try* to use it for non-profit projects.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to rain on your party, but I keep reading such statements in various places and it gets tiresome.

&quot;I got older&quot; (age is not related, you mean you changed) and the rant about Delphi are annoying. .NET has it&#039;s own set of quirks and also advantages.

I have more diversified interests as well. Just talk about the new, and don&#039;t diss the past.

Have fun with your future projects and enjoy the change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It took me a good 1 year to change our codebase in the past (when 2009 was released) to replace all string buffers for TBytes.

Its a huge amount of work but its worth it.. I didn&#039;t want to &quot;ansify&quot; my code by changing string to AnsiString to keep using it as data buffer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Using strings as buffers for binary data should have been abandoned when dynamic arrays were introduced. Oh, I know there is no Pos or concatenation for dynarrays, but if everyone had converted to them, and the demand had been there, someone (probably Borland) would have written those. Or one could have written them oneself.

In other words: I have absolutely no remorse for those who got in trouble when strings became 16-bit based because they used strings as binary buffers. They had some 15 years (or more?) to do the right thing and didn&#039;t.]]></description>
