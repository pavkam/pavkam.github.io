					<description><![CDATA[You say that these are value types.  I had a look at the code and see that the records contain dynamics arrays.  You also perform value copies of the record types which results value copies of the dynamic arrays.

Since dynamic arrays are reference types (not copy on write like strings) doesn&#039;t this make those copies actually reference copies?  I don&#039;t have a modern enough version of Delphi (I&#039;m still on D6) but what would happen for code like this:

var
  a, b: BigInteger;
begin
  a := 1;
  b := a;
  a := 2;  //what would be in b?
end;

Ah, now I think I see it!  In the line a := 2 what results is a call to

    constructor BigInteger.Create(const ANumber: Integer)

and this disconnects a from b.  Is that right?

If that is so then can we think of this technique as a way to get &quot;copy on write&quot; semantics for dynamic arrays?

Very interesting stuff!]]></description>
