Hello,

My name is *Alex*. I was born in post-soviet *Republic of Moldova*. After finishing high school, I continued my technical education in *Romania* where I lived for a good chunk of my life. But I could not stop there - so *Ireland* was my home for a while; then Brazil - where I lived with my beautiful wife. Currently, you can find me roaming about in *Portugal*

**As you might gather, I enjoy traveling and experiencing new places.**

Since the age of ten I started teaching myself computer programming on an old 8086 soviet clone ([EC1841](http://www.leningrad.su/museum/show_big.php?n=1038)). It was the era of “*DOS*”, *x86 assembly* and of course *Turbo Pascal*. Since then I programmed in *Delphi, C/C++, C#, F#, Javascript, Typescript, Python, Go, Lua*... I can throw in *TCL* in there for good measure.

Thirty years later I am still enjoying my profession - these days - using different tech stacks and and cloud environments.

And, if code is what you're looking for then go to my [GitHub](https://github.com/pavkam) page.
