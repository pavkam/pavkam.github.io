Hello,

My name is *Alex*. I was born in post-soviet _Republic of Moldova_. After finishing high school, I continued my technical education in _Romania_ where I lived for a good chunk of my life. But I could not stop there so _Ireland_ was my home for a while; then Brazil - where I lived with my beautiful wife for a while. 

**As you might gather, I enjoy travelling and experiencing new places.**

Since the age of ten I started teaching myself computer programming on an old 8086 soviet clone ([EC1841](/img/ec1841.jpeg)). It was the era of “_DOS_”, _x86 assembly_ and of course _Turbo Pascal_. Since then I programmed in _Delphi, C/C++, C#, F#_, etc.

Twenty years later I am still enjoying my profession - these days - using different tech stacks and and cloud environments.

Hope you found what you were looking for. But, if code is what you're looking for then go to my [GitHub](https://github.com/pavkam) page.

Enjoy!
